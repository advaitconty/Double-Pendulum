# Double Pendulu
A double pendulum, designed for Hack Club's #accelerate YSWS' week 1+2 project.
This one is built completely from scratch in SwiftUI, rendering with a canvas and paths. 

Warning: On Intel Macs, the physics may feel laggy as SwiftUI uses CPU rendering instead of Metal GPU rendering (very funny people i know)
